## formReForm Rendering Library for HTML Forms ##

formReForm takes a group of typical HTML form elements and creates a nice, clean, styleable form layout in 1, 2, or 4 columns.

### The Itch ###

Multi-column layouts for form elements have been a challenge; some developers find that their only option is a table-based layout or use only two columns (label + field).  As Responsive Design techniques have evolved, so must Responsive Forms.  Without knowing the exact size of the viewport or form container, a Responsive Form component would allow developers to layout a simple form and allow CSS/JS to the heavy lifting.

### The Scratch ###

formReForm uses CSS to take usable, accessible and correctly coded form elements and formReForms them into a style to fit any design and layout.  The current rendering method for this transformation is Javascript, but server-side rendering of the technique is also possible.

### The Details and Examples ###

The formReForm project started with two articles at dzone.com.  The original concept of using CSS to create a usable form was discussed the article [reForm: CSS Form Design Template for Any Layout](http://css.dzone.com/node/1457/).  Taking the idea one step further, the javascript library is discussed in the article [reForm: CSS Form Design Template for Any Layout (Part 2)](http://css.dzone.com/news/reform-css-form-design-templat-1)

### The Invite ###

The end goal of this concept is valid html that can be styled to fit any layout.  There are some limitations with the current library (only 4 columns are supported (label:field,label:field), for example).  Others are invited to contribute or comment.

### The Rights ###

It's GPL. Use, abuse, distribute, contribute ... but always attribute.

### The Small Print ###
